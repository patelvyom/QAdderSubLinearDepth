# Ancilla-Free Quantum Adder with Sublinear Depth

## Overview
Implementation of an **ancilla-free quantum adder** based on [Ancilla-free Quantum Adder with Sublinear Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16802)
that achieves **sublinear depth** while using only classical reversible logic (Toffoli, CNOT, and X gates). The
implementation is based on recent techniques in optimizing CNOT and Toffoli ladder circuits, allowing for efficient
ripple-carry addition without requiring ancilla qubits.
